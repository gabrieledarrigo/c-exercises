# C Exercises ðŸ•®

A list of C exercises and assignment for the "Computer Programming" course of 
["Sicurezza dei Sistemi e delle Reti Informatiche"](http://sicurezzaonline.di.unimi.it/) bachelor's degree program.  
They are quite basic, but they helped me to get some grip with the glorious C programming language!  

## Exercises and examples

- [power-of-two](./power-of-two.c): Compute all powers of base^exponent up to n, where both the base and the exponent are provided via user's input.
- [string-reverse](./string-reverse.c): Reverse a string in place.
- [palindrome](./palindrome.c): Check if a string is a palindrome.
- [triangle-sides](./triangle-sides.c): Given three numbers it checks if they are valid triangle sides.
